## Built 3D Game Mechanics in Godot!

This project demonstrates my skills in building core 3D gameplay mechanics:

- **3D Character Movement:** Implemented precise movement and collision detection using 3D coordinates and kinematic bodies, ensuring smooth and responsive player control.
- **Dynamic Monster Spawning:** Coded a system for strategically spawning monsters based on gameplay conditions, keeping players engaged and challenged.
- **Character Animation with Gameplay Integration:** Created a dynamic movement animation that adapts its speed and behavior to gameplay events, enhancing the player's immersion.
- **3D User Interface Integration:** Designed and seamlessly integrated a user interface directly within the 3D world, providing essential game information without breaking immersion.

**This project showcases my ability to create engaging 3D game experiences by implementing core gameplay mechanics with a focus on player experience and visual storytelling.**
